In order to replicate our CNN-Trans experiments, first collect the appropriate flow-based data and navigate to the respective dataset folder.
Then, perform the experiments from step1 to step4. This will perform the experiments done on CNN-Trans-1.

To perform the experiments done on CNN-Trans-2, you must first complete the above experiments.
	Then, run "get_CNN-Trans-2_data.ipynb". This will generate the data for CNN-Trans-2.
	Then, run "test_on_CNN-Trans-2_data.ipynb". This will use the data generated to test the models that were trained in step 4.
